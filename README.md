Classifying chess pieces has an interesting number of factors to consider:

* How is the piece shown to the algorithm? From above? Directly in front?
* Different chess-sets use different models for pieces, for example, some kings have very intricate styling.
* Not all chess sets use black and white pieces, many use different colours.

Of course, not all of these problems are solvable. But it should be possible for a Computer Vision CNN to do a pretty good job of classifying the majority of pieces.

My model managed a very high accuracy after training:

Testing on a validation set also showed promising results. Ultimately ending with around 98% accuracy.

A confusion matrix also showed pretty reliable predictions by the model on an outer sample test:

All in all it was a successful project. I will use this model now to attempt to train a chess-board detection algorithm.
